Layered with new world hops to create an all-out riot of grapefruit, pineapple and lychee before a spiky, mouth-puckering bitter finish.",

      'The Overlord of mango and chili IPAâ€™s packs a fruity punch and then some. Pours a slightly hazy orange. A tropical fruit assault on the nose, with mango, pineapple, apricots and citrus. Hints of chili and sweet malts follow. Fruit dissipates to a chili kick, not hot but definitely there, followed by a long bitter finish. All hail to the hot tempered sweet toothed Lord.',
